For the hardware setup, start by connecting the ultrasonic sensor to the esp32.
I connected the VCC pin to 5V, the trig pin to pin 13 on the esp32,
the echo pin to pin 14 on the esp32, and the gnd pin to ground. 
Then, connect the two servo motors to the esp32. 
Each requires a connection to 5V, ground and in input pin on the esp32.
I used pin 4 for the servo motor that rotates the ultrasonic sensor and pin 5 for the catapult's servo motor.
